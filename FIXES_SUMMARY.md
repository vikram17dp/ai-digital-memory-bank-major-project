# Memory Bank Fixes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with S3 storage, toast notifications, and memory management features (edit, delete, favorites).

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed S3 Implementation (`lib/s3.ts`)
**Issue**: Import errors because `lib/s3.ts` didn't exist, routes were trying to import from it.

**Solution**: Created new `lib/s3.ts` with proper AWS SDK v3 implementation:
- ✅ Proper function signatures: `uploadToS3(buffer, fileName, contentType)`
- ✅ Uses modern AWS SDK v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`)
- ✅ Image optimization with Sharp
- ✅ Proper S3 deletion handling
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Supports multiple file deletions

**Files Created**:
- `lib/s3.ts` - New S3 utility with correct exports

### 2. ✅ Fixed Toast Notification Duration (`app/layout.tsx`)
**Issue**: Toast notifications showing for 1+ minute instead of 2-3 seconds.

**Solution**: Updated Toaster configuration:
```tsx
<Toaster 
  richColors 
  position="top-right"
  expand={false}
  duration={2500}      // Default 2.5 seconds
  closeButton          // Allow manual dismissal
/>
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Updated Toaster props

### 3. ✅ Implemented Favorites Toggle (`components/memory-card.tsx`)
**Issue**: No way to add/remove memories from favorites.

**Solution**: Added full favorites functionality:
- ✅ Star button in card header (always visible)
- ✅ Toggle button in detail modal
- ✅ Visual feedback (filled/unfilled star)
- ✅ API integration with PUT `/api/memory/[id]`
- ✅ Toast notifications (2 seconds)
- ✅ Automatic UI refresh
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

**Features Added**:
- `handleToggleFavorite()` - Async function to toggle favorite status
- State management with `isFavorite` and `isTogglingFavorite`
- Router refresh on success
- Proper error handling

### 4. ✅ Implemented Delete Functionality (`components/memory-card.tsx`)
**Issue**: No way to delete memories.

**Solution**: Added complete delete workflow:
- ✅ Delete button in detail modal
- ✅ Confirmation dialog (AlertDialog)
- ✅ Deletes images from S3
- ✅ Deletes record from database (Prisma/Supabase)
- ✅ Loading states during deletion
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Automatic UI refresh

**Features Added**:
- `handleDelete()` - Async function with S3 cleanup
- `AlertDialog` component for confirmation
- Proper loading states
- API integration with DELETE `/api/memory/[id]`

### 5. ✅ Updated Toast Durations Across All Components

**Files Modified**:
- `components/add-memory-form.tsx` - All toast durations set to 2-2.5 seconds
- `components/edit-memory-dialog.tsx` - Toast durations standardized
- `components/memory-card.tsx` - Consistent toast timing

**Toast Duration Standards**:
- Success messages: 2000-2500ms
- Error messages: 2500ms
- Info messages: 2000ms
- Loading messages: Auto-dismiss on completion

## API Routes Used

### Memory Management
- `PUT /api/memory/[id]` - Update memory (edit, favorites toggle)
- `DELETE /api/memory/[id]` - Delete memory with S3 cleanup
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload images to S3

- Store S3 URLs in Supabase
- AI-powered memory extraction
- Manual entry with rich form

### ✅ Memory Editing
- Edit all memory fields
- Add/remove images
- Update tags, mood, location, people
- S3 image uploads on edit

### ✅ Memory Deletion
- Confirmation dialog
- Delete from database (Prisma → Supabase)
- Delete images from S3
- Proper cleanup

### ✅ Favorites
- Toggle favorite status
- Visual star indicator
- Quick toggle from card or modal
- Persistent across sessions

### ✅ Toast Notifications
- Fast (2-3 seconds)
- Consistent timing
- Rich colors
- Close button
- Action buttons where needed

## Migration Notes

If using the old `lib/aws-s3.ts`, you can now switch to `lib/s3.ts`:
- New file uses AWS SDK v3
- Same functionality, better performance
- Proper TypeScript types
- Better error handling

## Dependencies

Make sure these are installed:
```json
{
  "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.x.x",
  "sharp": "^0.x.x",
  "uuid": "^9.x.x",
  "sonner": "^1.x.x"
}
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check AWS credentials in `.env`
2. Verify S3 bucket permissions
3. Check database connection
4. Review browser console for errors
5. Check server logs for S3 upload errors
