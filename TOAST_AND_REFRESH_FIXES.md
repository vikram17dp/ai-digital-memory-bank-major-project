### 2. ✅ Auto-Refresh - FIXED

**Problem:** Page required manual refresh to see changes

**Solution Applied:**

#### Dashboard Page Changes:
```typescript
// Added to app/dashboard/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 0
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

This ensures:
- ✅ No caching of dashboard data
- ✅ Always fetches fresh data from database
- ✅ `router.refresh()` works immediately
- ✅ Changes appear instantly

#### How It Works Now:

1. **After Creating Memory:**
   - Memory saved to database ✅
   - Toast shows for 3 seconds ✅
   - Auto-redirects to memories page (1 sec delay) ✅
   - Memories page shows new data ✅

2. **After Editing Memory:**
   - Memory updated in database ✅
   - Toast shows for 3 seconds ✅
   - `router.refresh()` called ✅
   - Page reloads with fresh data ✅

3. **After Deleting Memory:**
   - Memory removed from database ✅
   - S3 images deleted ✅
   - Toast shows for 3 seconds ✅
   - `router.refresh()` called ✅
   - Memory disappears from list ✅

4. **After Toggling Favorites:**
   - Database updated ✅
   - Toast shows for 2 seconds ✅
   - `router.refresh()` called ✅
   - Heart icon updates ✅

### 3. ✅ Complete Toast Guidelines

**Loading Toasts:** (stay until operation completes)
```typescript
toast.loading('Processing...', { 
  id: 'operation-id',
  duration: Infinity 
})
```

**Success Toasts:** (2-3 seconds)
```typescript
toast.success('Done!', { 
  id: 'operation-id',  // dismisses loading toast
  duration: 2000 
})
```

**Error Toasts:** (3 seconds - more time to read)
```typescript
toast.error('Failed', { 
  id: 'operation-id',  // dismisses loading toast
  duration: 3000 
})
```

**Info/Warning Toasts:** (2 seconds)
```typescript
toast.info('Info message', { duration: 2000 })
toast.warning('Warning', { duration: 2000 })
```
