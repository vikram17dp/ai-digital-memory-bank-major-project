# Memory Upload Fix

## Problem
Users couldn't upload memories due to a database schema mismatch error:
```
Unknown argument `title`. Did you mean `date`?
```

The application was trying to save memory data with fields that didn't exist in the database schema.

## Root Cause
The Prisma schema for the `Memory` model was missing several fields that the application code was trying to use:

**Missing fields:**
- `title` (optional string for memory title)
- `location` (optional string for where the memory took place)
- `people` (optional string for people involved)
- `imageUrl` (optional string for main image URL)
- `images` (array of image URLs)
- `sentiment` (string for sentiment analysis result)
- `isPrivate` (boolean flag for privacy)
- `isFavorite` (boolean flag for favorites)

## Solution
Updated the Prisma schema to include all required fields:

### Changes Made

**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**

Added the following fields to the Memory model:
```prisma
model Memory {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  title       String?                        // NEW
  content     String
  tags        String[]
  mood        Mood     @default(neutral)
  date        DateTime @default(now())
  location    String?                        // NEW
  people      String?                        // NEW
  imageUrl    String?                        // NEW
  images      String[]                       // NEW
  sentiment   String   @default("neutral")   // NEW
  isPrivate   Boolean  @default(false)       // NEW
  isFavorite  Boolean  @default(false)       // NEW
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([userId, date(sort: Desc)])
  @@index([userId, mood])
  @@index([userId, isFavorite])              // NEW INDEX
  @@map("Memory") 
}
```

### Database Migration
Ran `npx prisma db push` to sync the schema changes with the database.

## Result
✅ Memory model now includes all fields used by the application
✅ Users can successfully upload memories with images
✅ Database operations work correctly
✅ Additional indexes for better query performance

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Yes | Unique identifier (CUID) |
| `userId` | String | Yes | Clerk user ID |
| `title` | String? | No | Optional title for the memory |
| `content` | String | Yes | Main content/description |
| `tags` | String[] | Yes | Array of tags for categorization |
| `mood` | Mood | Yes | User's mood (positive/neutral/negative) |
| `date` | DateTime | Yes | When the memory occurred |
| `location` | String? | No | Where the memory took place |
| `people` | String? | No | People involved in the memory |
| `imageUrl` | String? | No | Main image URL (first image) |
| `images` | String[] | Yes | Array of all image URLs |
| `sentiment` | String | Yes | AI-analyzed sentiment |
| `isPrivate` | Boolean | Yes | Privacy flag (default: false) |
| `isFavorite` | Boolean | Yes | Favorite flag (default: false) |
| `createdAt` | DateTime | Yes | When record was created |
| `updatedAt` | DateTime | Yes | When record was last updated |

## Testing
To test memory upload:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Click "Add Memory" or upload a memory with images
4. The memory should save successfully with all fields

## Notes
- All optional fields use the `?` modifier in the schema
- Default values are set for boolean and enum fields
- Additional index on `isFavorite` improves query performance for favorite memories
- The `images` field stores all image URLs as an array
- The `imageUrl` field stores the primary/first image for quick access
