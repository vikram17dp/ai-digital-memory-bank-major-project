# AI Memory Bank Setup Guide

This guide will help you fix all the issues you mentioned and properly configure your AI Memory Bank application.

## Issues Fixed

✅ **Database connection and user creation errors**  
✅ **AWS S3 upload functionality**  
✅ **Hugging Face API integration**  
✅ **Environment variable validation**  
✅ **Third step card display with images**  
✅ **Better error handling throughout**  

## Required Environment Variables

I've created a `.env.local` file template. You need to update it with your actual credentials:

### 1. Database Configuration
```bash
# Update these with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/ai_memory_bank?schema=public"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/ai_memory_bank?schema=public"
```

### 2. Clerk Authentication
```bash
# Get these from your Clerk dashboard (https://clerk.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_key_here
```

### 3. AWS Configuration
```bash
# Create these in AWS Console > IAM > Users > Access Keys
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_actual_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

### 4. Hugging Face API
```bash
# Get this from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Update Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file I created
2. Replace all placeholder values with your actual credentials
3. Save the file

### 2. Database Setup

If you haven't set up your database yet:

```bash
# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. AWS S3 Setup

1. Create an S3 bucket in AWS Console
2. Create IAM user with S3 permissions
3. Generate access keys for the user
4. Update the bucket policy to allow public read access (optional)

### 4. Hugging Face Setup

1. Create account at https://huggingface.co
2. Go to Settings > Access Tokens
3. Create a new token with "Read" permissions
4. Copy the token to your `.env.local` file

### 5. Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Database Error Fixes
- Added retry logic for user creation
- Better error handling for race conditions
- Improved database connection validation

### 2. AWS S3 Integration
- Added configuration validation
- Better error messages
- Graceful fallback when AWS is not configured
- Null safety checks throughout

### 3. Hugging Face API
- Added API key validation
- Fallback sentiment analysis using keywords
- Better timeout and retry handling
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Fixed card display in step 3 to show uploaded images
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Improved loading states
- Enhanced visual feedback

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Database Connection
Try adding a memory manually - this will test database connectivity and user creation.

### 2. Test AWS S3 Upload
Upload an image in step 3 - you should see it upload to your S3 bucket.

### 3. Test Hugging Face AI
Try the AI mode in step 1 - it should analyze sentiment and extract content.

### 4. Test Manual Mode
Try adding a memory manually to ensure basic functionality works.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to ensure user exists in database"
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Ensure your database is running
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create tables

### "AWS S3 is not configured"
- Check your AWS credentials in `.env.local`
- Verify your S3 bucket exists and is accessible
- Check IAM permissions for your access keys

### "Hugging Face client not available"
- Verify your `HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY` is correct
- Check if you have API quota remaining
- The app will work with fallback methods if HF is unavailable

### Images not showing in step 3 preview
- This has been fixed - the card now shows uploaded images
- Make sure images are under 5MB and in supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check your terminal/server logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure all services (database, AWS, HF) are accessible

The application now has much better error handling and will provide clear feedback about what's not working.
